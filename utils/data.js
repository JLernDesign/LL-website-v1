    title: 'Trauma/PTSD',
    desc: 'I see trauma as a psychological injury rather than a disorder. And just like other injuries, there are a number of techniques to help facilitate healing trauma. Often times, the auxiliary symptoms of trauma are attempted to be treated (depression, anxiety/panic) yet there is a lingering, deeper need to resolve the unprocessed emotions related to the occurrences that we didn’t feel we had adequate resources for. I can help you to explore the ways in which trauma is still impacting you, utilizing both cognitive and somatic strategies to help heal these injuries.',

    title: 'Addiction/Co-Dependency',
    desc: 'I can help individuals who have struggled to get and stay sober or are grappling with how to better control their use.

Additionally, I can help loved ones and family members of those struggling with addiction to help navigate setting boundaries and increasing self-care in coping with this.
